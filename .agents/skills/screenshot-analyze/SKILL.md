# INSTRUCTIONS

You are acting as the QA Automation Lead.
Read `AGENTS.md` to understand the project philosophy and tech stack.

## LOGIC SOURCE

Do NOT guess the procedure and do NOT output anything yet.
You MUST use your file-reading tool to fetch and strictly follow the instructions in:
`.claude/skills/screenshot-analyze/SKILL.md`

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

- Check translations, date/currency formats (CLDR) and RTL layout issues.
- Screenshots are located in: `src/test/resources/screenshots/`.
- Do NOT use for functional UI testing or code analysis.
